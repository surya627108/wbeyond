Below is a `README.md` file tailored for your Sales Forecasting project, summarizing the Jupyter Notebook setup, dataset details, code structure, and instructions for running the code. It assumes the project is stored in a Git repository or a local directory with all the necessary files.

# Sales Forecasting Data Science Internship Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a sales forecasting solution for a retail dataset, predicting daily sales for various product families across multiple stores over a 15-day period. It follows a two-part structure: **Data Processing and Feature Engineering (Day 1)** and **Model Selection, Forecasting, and Evaluation (Day 2)**. The goal is to leverage historical sales data and external factors (e.g., oil prices, holidays) to build and compare multiple forecasting models.

Developed as part of a Data Science Internship Assignment using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of five CSV files:
- **`train.csv`**: Historical sales data with columns like `date`, `store_nbr`, `family`, `sales`, and `onpromotion`.
- **`test.csv`**: Test set for predictions, similar to `train.csv` but without `sales`.
- **`stores.csv`**: Store metadata including `store_nbr`, `city`, `state`, `type`, and `cluster`.
- **`oil.csv`**: Daily oil prices (`date`, `dcoilwtico`), reflecting Ecuador’s economic conditions.
- **`holidays_events.csv`**: Holiday and event data with `date`, `type`, `locale`, `locale_name`, `description`, and `transferred`.

The task is to predict sales for the 15 days following the last date in `train.csv` for each store-product family combination in `test.csv`.

---

## Project Structure
The solution is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook:



---

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Libraries**:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm statsmodels tensorflow
  ```
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the `.ipynb` file.
- **Dataset Files**: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `stores.csv`, `oil.csv`, `holidays_events.csv` in the working directory.

---

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone/Download the Project**:
   - If in a Git repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Otherwise, download the notebook and dataset files.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually install the libraries listed above.

3. **Place Dataset Files**:
   - Ensure `train.csv`, `test.csv`, `stores.csv`, `oil.csv`, and `holidays_events.csv` are in the same directory as the notebook.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file (e.g., `Sales_Forecasting.ipynb`).

---

## Running the Code
1. **Execute Cells Sequentially**:
   -Each cell builds on the previous ones.
   - prepare the data; train models and generate outputs.

2. **Key Outputs**:
   - **EDA Plots**: Sales trends, holiday effects, oil price correlations .
   - **Metrics Table**: RMSE, MAPE, R² for all models .
   - **Prediction Plots**: Actual vs. predicted sales for each model .
   - **Feature Importance**: For Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM .
   - **Submission Files**: `submission_<model>.csv` for each model.

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If `KeyError: 'sales'` occurs in Cell 22, ensure `test` retains `store_nbr` and `family` from earlier cells.
   - If a model is missing in Cell 18, check its training cell for errors.

---

## Notes
- **ARIMA Limitation**: Applied to a single store-family series due to computational constraints. For full coverage, loop over all combinations (not implemented here).
- **Naïve Model**: Uses the last known sales as a baseline, with mean imputation for missing values.
- **Performance**: Model accuracy depends on dataset size and quality. Tune hyperparameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, LSTM epochs) for better results.
- **Submission**: Six CSV files are generated, one per model. Use the best-performing model (e.g., XGBoost) for final submission.

---

## Sample Output Files
- `submission_naive.csv`
- `submission_arima.csv`
- `submission_rf.csv`
- `submission_xgb.csv`
- `submission_lgb.csv`
- `submission_lstm.csv`

Each file contains `id` and `sales` columns for the test set predictions.

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement Prophet for seasonality modeling (bonus challenge).
- Optimize ARIMA for all store-family combinations.
- Add hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM.
- Use SHAP values for LSTM feature importance.
